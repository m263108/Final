# Final
My code is under Nolan Jess Final, not Final. The game is called Mule Invasion. The goal is to get rid of all of the mules before they hit you or the bottom. After you kill all mules, the level will restart and be faster. Making the game harder. You use space to throw a football and the arrow keys to move around.
